        <h2>Project Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Intergalactic Paws is a demolition derby in space. The main character is a humaniod cat who is defending Earth from 
            aliens that have the intent to invade our home planet. Every 100 years, all of the races in the galaxy come 
            together to battle it out in an aggressive championship on the moon. The player must stay in the crater of the moon 
            and must keep their car running, in order to win. If you are knocked out of the arena, or blow your engine, then you 
            lose and that is the downfall of Earth as we know it.
